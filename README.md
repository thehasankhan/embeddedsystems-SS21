# embeddedsystems-SS21
This is the git repository for the embedded systems lab typing challenge game

We are using a 16x2 display for the letter sewuence and to display the result of the player as well. The letters will be displayed on the screen for a period of time which can be changed. They will then disappear and the player would have to remember the letters from memory and type them to win.

The arduino is connected to a USB type-A female connector which will be connected to a standard USB keyboard.
